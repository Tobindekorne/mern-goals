# GoalSetter

This app is a project to practice using the MERN stack. This project is [live here](https://mernapptobin.herokuapp.com). To run locally, you will need the mongodb credentials added to your environment variables (or create your own db!). The dev environment can be ran with `npm run dev`. Deployment to Heroku can be done with `git push heroku master` and the `heroku-postbuild` script will run.
